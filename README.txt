This repository was the backbone of my Bc. thesis 'Flight Delay Prediction using Machine Learning'.

The data for the project was taken from : Bureau of Transportation Statistics, United States Department of Transportation. Available at: https://www.transtats.bts.gov/ontime/

Included in this repository will be the actual csv files that I'd used/imported into the notebooks for future processing.
